  abstract = {When designing a study, the planned sample size is often based on power analyses. One way to choose an effect size for power analyses is by relying on pilot data. A-priori power analyses are only accurate when the effect size estimate is accurate. In this paper we highlight two sources of bias when performing a-priori power analyses for between-subject designs based on pilot data. First, we examine how the choice of the effect size index ({$\eta$}2, {$\omega$}2 and {$\epsilon$}2) affects the sample size and power of the main study. Based on our observations, we recommend against the use of {$\eta$}2 in a-priori power analyses. Second, we examine how the maximum sample size researchers are willing to collect in a main study (e.g. due to time or financial constraints) leads to overestimated effect size estimates in the studies that are performed. Determining the required sample size exclusively based on the effect size estimates from pilot data, and following up on pilot studies only when the sample size estimate for the main study is considered feasible, creates what we term follow-up bias. We explain how follow-up bias leads to underpowered main studies. Our simulations show that designing main studies based on effect sizes estimated from small pilot studies does not yield desired levels of power due to accuracy bias and follow-up bias, even when publication bias is not an issue. We urge researchers to consider alternative approaches to determining the sample size of their studies, and discuss several options.},

  abstract = {It is widely acknowledged that the biomedical literature suffers from a surfeit of false positive results. Part of the reason for this is the persistence of the myth that observation of p {$<$} 0.05 is sufficient justification to claim that you have made a discovery. It is hopeless to expect users to change their reliance on p-values unless they are offered an alternative way of judging the reliability of their conclusions. If the alternative method is to have a chance of being adopted widely, it will have to be easy to understand and to calculate. One such proposal is based on calculation of false positive risk(FPR). It is suggested that p-values and confidence intervals should continue to be given, but that they should be supplemented by a single additional number that conveys the strength of the evidence better than the p-value. This number could be the minimum FPR (that calculated on the assumption of a prior probability of 0.5, the largest value that can be assumed in the absence of hard prior data). Alternatively one could specify the prior probability that it would be necessary to believe in order to achieve an FPR of, say, 0.05.},

  abstract = {We wish to answer this question: If you observe a `significant' p-value after doing a single unbiased experiment, what is the probability that your result is a false positive? The weak evidence provided by p-values between 0.01 and 0.05 is explored by exact calculations of false positive risks. When you observe p\,=\,0.05, the odds in favour of there being a real effect (given by the likelihood ratio) are about 3\,:\,1. This is far weaker evidence than the odds of 19 to 1 that might, wrongly, be inferred from the p-value. And if you want to limit the false positive risk to 5\%, you would have to assume that you were 87\% sure that there was a real effect before the experiment was done. If you observe p\,=\,0.001 in a well-powered experiment, it gives a likelihood ratio of almost 100\,:\,1 odds on there being a real effect. That would usually be regarded as conclusive. But the false positive risk would still be 8\% if the prior probability of a real effect were only 0.1. And, in this case, if you wanted to achieve a false positive risk of 5\% you would need to observe p\,=\,0.00045. It is recommended that the terms `significant' and `non-significant' should never be used. Rather, p-values should be supplemented by specifying the prior probability that would be needed to produce a specified (e.g. 5\%) false positive risk. It may also be helpful to specify the minimum false positive risk associated with the observed p-value. Despite decades of warnings, many areas of science still insist on labelling a result of p\,{$<$}\,0.05 as `statistically significant'. This practice must contribute to the lack of reproducibility in some areas of science. This is before you get to the many other well-known problems, like multiple comparisons, lack of randomization and p-hacking. Precise inductive inference is impossible and replication is the only way to be sure. Science is endangered by statistical misunderstanding, and by senior people who impose perverse incentives on scientists.},

The setting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, possibly with ``nuisance parameters'') versus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of nature of unknown strength). The ppp value, as well as the ratio of the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the alternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian posterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The academic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this paradox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific communication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to frontier research in high energy physics. This paper is an attempt to explain the situation to both physicists and statisticians, in the hope that further progress can be made.},

  abstract = {The ``replication crisis'' has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The ``null ritual,'' unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 \textendash{} p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20\% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39\% of the professors and lecturers, and 66\% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 \textendash{} p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56\%\textendash 97\%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as ``significant'' or ``not significant.''},

Although significance testing and p-values are often presented as prescriptive procedures, they came about through a process of refinement and extension to other disciplines. Ronald A. Fisher and his contemporaries formalized these methods in the early twentieth century and Fisher's 1925 Statistical Methods for Research Workers brought the techniques to experimentalists in a variety of disciplines. Understanding how these methods arose, spread, and were argued over since then illuminates how p {$<$} 0.05 came to be a standard for scientific inference, the advantage it offered at the time, and how it was interpreted. This historical perspective can inform the work of statisticians today by encouraging thoughtful consideration of how their work, including proposed alternatives to the p-value, will be perceived and used by scientists. And it can engage students more fully and encourage critical thinking rather than rote applications of formulae. Incorporating history enables students, practitioners, and statisticians to treat the discipline as an ongoing endeavor, crafted by fallible humans, and provides a deeper understanding of the subject and its consequences for science and society.},

We explain a range of approaches to determine the SESOI in psychological science and provide detailed examples of how equivalence tests should be performed and reported.

In most fields, {$\alpha$} = 0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as {$\alpha$} = 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal {$\alpha$} level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although {$\alpha$} = 0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal {$\alpha$} could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one {$\alpha$} level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular {$\alpha$} level.},

  title = {Statistical rituals: The replication delusion and how we got there},
  issn = {2515-2459},
  abstract = {The ``replication crisis'' has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers' widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The ``null ritual,'' unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 \textendash{} p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20\% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39\% of the professors and lecturers, and 66\% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 \textendash{} p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56\%\textendash{}97\%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as ``significant'' or ``not significant.''},

The setting is the test of a well-specified null hypothesis (such as the Standard Model of elementary particle physics, possibly with ``nuisance parameters'') versus a composite alternative (such as the Standard Model plus a new force of nature of unknown strength). The ppp value, as well as the ratio of the likelihood under the null hypothesis to the maximized likelihood under the alternative, can strongly disfavor the null hypothesis, while the Bayesian posterior probability for the null hypothesis can be arbitrarily large. The academic statistics literature contains many impassioned comments on this paradox, yet there is no consensus either on its relevance to scientific communication or on its correct resolution. The paradox is quite relevant to frontier research in high energy physics. This paper is an attempt to explain the situation to both physicists and statisticians, in the hope that further progress can be made.},

  volume = {7},

  abstract = {Null hypothesis significance testing has been under attack in recent years, partly owing to the arbitrary nature of setting {$\alpha$} (the decision-making threshold and probability of Type I error) at a constant value, usually 0.05. If the goal of null hypothesis testing is to present conclusions in which we have the highest possible confidence, then the only logical decision-making threshold is the value that minimizes the probability (or occasionally, cost) of making errors. Setting {$\alpha$} to minimize the combination of Type I and Type II error at a critical effect size can easily be accomplished for traditional statistical tests by calculating the {$\alpha$} associated with the minimum average of {$\alpha$} and {$\beta$} at the critical effect size. This technique also has the flexibility to incorporate prior probabilities of null and alternate hypotheses and/or relative costs of Type I and Type II errors, if known. Using an optimal {$\alpha$} results in stronger scientific inferences because it estimates and minimizes both Type I errors and relevant Type II errors for a test. It also results in greater transparency concerning assumptions about relevant effect size(s) and the relative costs of Type I and II errors. By contrast, the use of {$\alpha$} = 0.05 results in arbitrary decisions about what effect sizes will likely be considered significant, if real, and results in arbitrary amounts of Type II error for meaningful potential effect sizes. We cannot identify a rationale for continuing to arbitrarily use {$\alpha$} = 0.05 for null hypothesis significance tests in any field, when it is possible to determine an optimal {$\alpha$}.},

  title = {Statistical Principles in Experimental Design},
  abstract = {"Written primarily for students and research workers in the area of the behavioral sciences, this book is meant to provide a text and comprehensive reference source on statistical principles underlying experimental design. Particular emphasis is given to those designs that are likely to prove useful in research in the behavioral sciences. The book primarily emphasizes the logical basis of principles underlying designs for experiments rather than mathematical derivations associated with relevant sampling distributions. The topics selected for inclusion are those covered in courses taught by the author during the past several years. Students in these courses have widely varying backgrounds in mathematics and come primarily from the fields of psychology, education, economics, sociology, and industrial engineering. It has been the intention of the author to keep the book at a readability level appropriate for students having a mathematical background equivalent to freshman college algebra. From experience with those sections of the book which have been used as text material in dittoed form, there is evidence to indicate that, in large measure, the desired readability level has been attained. Admittedly, however, there are some sections in the book where this readability goal has not been achieved. The first course in design, as taught by the author, has as a prerequisite a basic course in statistical inference. The contents of Chaps. 1 and 2 review the highlights of what is included in the prerequisite material. These chapters are not meant to provide the reader with a first exposure to these topics. They are intended to provide a review of terminology and notation for the concepts which are more fully developed in later chapters. By no means is all the material included in the book covered in a one semester course. In a course of this length, the author has included Chaps. 3, 4, parts of 5, 6, parts of 7, parts of 10, and parts of 11. Chapters 8 through 11 were written to be somewhat independent of each other. Hence one may read, with understanding, in these chapters without undue reference to material in the others. In general, the discussion of principles, interpretations of illustrative examples, and computational procedures are included in successive sections within the same chapter. However, to facilitate the use of the book as a reference source, this procedure is not followed in Chaps. 5 and 6. Basic principles associated with a large class of designs for factorial experiments are discussed in Chap. 5. Detailed illustrative examples of these designs are presented in Chap. 6. For teaching purposes, the author includes relevant material from Chap. 6 with the corresponding material in Chap. 5. Selected topics from Chaps. 7 through 11 have formed the basis for a second course in experimental design. Relatively complete tables for sampling distributions of statistics used in the analysis of experimental designs are included in the Appendix. Ample references to source materials having mathematical proofs for the principles stated in the text are provided"--Preface.

  title = {The Quest for an Optimal Alpha},
  volume = {14},
  issn = {1932-6203},
  abstract = {Researchers who analyze data within the framework of null hypothesis significance testing must choose a critical ``alpha'' level, {$\alpha$}, to use as a cutoff for deciding whether a given set of data demonstrates the presence of a particular effect. In most fields, {$\alpha$} = 0.05 has traditionally been used as the standard cutoff. Many researchers have recently argued for a change to a more stringent evidence cutoff such as {$\alpha$} = 0.01, 0.005, or 0.001, noting that this change would tend to reduce the rate of false positives, which are of growing concern in many research areas. Other researchers oppose this proposed change, however, because it would correspondingly tend to increase the rate of false negatives. We show how a simple statistical model can be used to explore the quantitative tradeoff between reducing false positives and increasing false negatives. In particular, the model shows how the optimal {$\alpha$} level depends on numerous characteristics of the research area, and it reveals that although {$\alpha$} = 0.05 would indeed be approximately the optimal value in some realistic situations, the optimal {$\alpha$} could actually be substantially larger or smaller in other situations. The importance of the model lies in making it clear what characteristics of the research area have to be specified to make a principled argument for using one {$\alpha$} level rather than another, and the model thereby provides a blueprint for researchers seeking to justify a particular {$\alpha$} level.},

	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/af9by/},
	abstract = {Researchers commonly make dichotomous claims based on continuous test statistics. Many have branded the practice as misuse of statistics, and criticize scientists for suffering from âdichotomaniaâ. However, the role dichotomous claims play in science is not primarily a statistical one, but an epistemological and pragmatic one. The epistemological function of dichotomous claims consists in transforming data into factual statements that can falsify a universal statement. This transformation requires pre-specified methodological decision procedures such as statistical hypothesis testing (e.g., Neyman-Pearson tests). From the perspective of methodological falsificationism these decision procedures are necessary, as probabilistic statements (e.g. continuous test statistics) cannot function as falsifiers of substantive hypotheses. However, they are not sufficient since for dichotomous claims to have any implication regarding theoretical claims about phenomena, there should be a valid derivation chain linking theoretical, experimental and data models. The pragmatic function of dichotomous claims is facilitating scrutiny and criticism among peers by generating contestable statements, a process referred to by Popper as 'conjectures and refutations', through which we can determine which theories withstand scrutiny the best. Abandoning dichotomous claims to combat the misuse of statistics would not improve scientific inferences but will sacrifice these crucial epistemic and pragmatic functions.},

	title = {Sample {Size} {Justification}},
	url = {https://psyarxiv.com/9d3yf/},
	abstract = {An important step when designing a study is to justify the sample size that will be collected. The key aim of a sample size justification is to explain how the collected data is expected to provide valuable information given the inferential goals of the researcher. In this overview article six approaches are discussed to justify the sample size in a quantitative empirical study: 1) collecting data from (an)almost) the entire population, 2) choosing a sample size based on resource constraints, 3) performing an a-priori power analysis, 4) planning for a desired accuracy, 5) using heuristics, or 6) explicitly acknowledging the absence of a justification. An important question to consider when justifying sample sizes is which effect sizes are deemed interesting, and the extent to which the data that is collected informs inferences about these effect sizes. Depending on the sample size justification chosen, researchers could consider 1) what the smallest effect size of interest is, 2) which minimal effect size will be statistically significant, 3) which effect sizes they expect (and what they base these expectations on), 4) which effect sizes would be rejected based on a confidence interval around the effect size, 5) which ranges of effects a study has sufficient power to detect based on a sensitivity power analysis, and 6) which effect sizes are plausible in a specific research area. Researchers can use the guidelines presented in this article to improve their sample size justification, and hopefully, align the informational value of a study with their inferential goals.},

By framing issues, identifying risks, eliciting stakeholder preferences, and suggesting alternative approaches, decision analysts can offer workable solutions in domains such as the environment, health and medicine, engineering and operations research, and public policy. This book is a mixture of historical and forward-looking essays on key topics in decision analysis. Part I covers the history and foundations of decision analysis. Part II discusses structuring decision problems, including the development of objectives and their attributes, and influence diagrams. Part III discusses probabilities and their elicitation and Bayes nets. Part IV discusses additive and multiplicative utilities, risk preferences, and 'option pricing' methods. Part V discusses risk analysis. Part VI puts decision analysis in a behavioral and organizational context. Part VII presents case studies of applications.},

	abstract = {The âreplication crisisâ has been attributed to perverse incentives that lead to selective reporting and misinterpretations of P-values and confidence intervals. A crude fix offered for this problem is to lower testing cut-offs (Î± levels), either directly or in the form of null-biased multiple comparisons procedures such as naÃ¯ve Bonferroni adjustments. Methodologists and statisticians have expressed positions that range from condemning all such procedures to demanding their application in almost all analyses. Navigating between these unjustifiable extremes requires defining analysis goals precisely enough to separate inappropriate from appropriate adjustments. To meet this need, I here review issues arising in single-parameter inference (such as error costs and loss functions) that are often skipped in basic statistics, yet are crucial to understanding controversies in testing and multiple comparisons. I also review considerations that should be made when examining arguments for and against modifications of decision cut-offs and adjustments for multiple comparisons. The goal is to provide researchers a better understanding of what is assumed by each side and to enable recognition of hidden assumptions. Basic issues of goal specification and error costs are illustrated with simple fixed cut-off hypothesis testing scenarios. These illustrations show how adjustment choices are extremely sensitive to implicit decision costs, making it inevitable that different stakeholders will vehemently disagree about what is necessary or appropriate. Because decisions cannot be justified without explicit costs, resolution of inference controversies is impossible without recognising this sensitivity. Pre-analysis statements of funding, scientific goals, and analysis plans can help counter demands for inappropriate adjustments, and can provide guidance as to what adjustments are advisable. Hierarchical (multilevel) regression methods (including Bayesian, semi-Bayes, and empirical-Bayes methods) provide preferable alternatives to conventional adjustments, insofar as they facilitate use of background information in the analysis model, and thus can provide better-informed estimates on which to base inferences and decisions.},
